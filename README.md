# ExcerciseASP
Multi-tier RESTful API application.

Before running the application, run 'Update-Database' in Package Console to create the database. If you receive 'Cannot attach the file' error, simply rename the 'Initial Catalog' and 'AttachDbFilename' parameters in the connection string in \ExcerciseASP\Web.config and try again.
